"""
Usage: (python) q1.py <PASS FILE> <FAIL FILE>

Reads a pair of input FASTQ file as processed by poretools and counts
the number of 1D and 2D reads that were found in each, as well as the
number of 2D reads found in both.

I wrote this code for my project with my last group and am reusing it. Other group members are responsible for some minor bugfixes.
